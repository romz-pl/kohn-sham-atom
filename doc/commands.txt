This file contains the description of commands from input file for RAtom.


Atom_Proton [positive integer]
  Number of protons in atom  

Atom_Rc [real number]
  Radius of the atom in bohrs

XC_Exch [possible values: slater, null]
  Name of exchange approximation.

XC_Corr [possible values: vwn, null]
  Name of correlation approximation.


Rho0_Default [possible values: Yes, No]
  Defines the type of initial density representation.
     If "Yes" then the default density is calculated from following equation:
        \rho_0(r) = N^4/16 r^2 \exp{-Nr/2}
     where $N$ is the number of electrons in the system.

     If "No" then two parameters Rho0_c, Rho0_Alpha are read, and following
     equation defines initial density
        \rho_0(r) = 4 \pi c r^2 \exp{-\alpha r}
 

Rho0_c [real number]
  See parameter Rho0_Default


Rho0_Alpha [real number]
  See parameter Rho0_Default


Solver_EigAdapt [possible values: Yes, No]
  If "yes" adaptive algorithm is applied.

Solver_EigNode [positive integer]
  Number of nodes used for solution of eigenvalue problem.
  If adaptive solved is used, then this parameter defines the initial
  number of nodes.

Solver_EigDeg [positive integer]
  Degree of applied Lobatto polynomials for eigenvalue problem.

Solver_EigAbsMaxCoef [real number]
  Maximal allowed expantion coefficient in adaptive procedure
  for eigenvalue problem. 

Solver_EigAbsTol [real number]
  Absolute error for calculation of eigenvalues for procedure 
  dsbevx from LAPACK library.

Solver_PsnAdapt [possible values: Yes, No]
  If "Yes", then adaptive solver for Poisson equation is used.

Solver_PsnNode [positive integer]
  Number of nodes used for solution of Poisson equation.
  If adaptive solved is used, then this parameter defines the initial
  number of nodes.

Solver_PsnDeg [positive integer]
  Degree of applied Lobatto polynomials for Poisson equation.

Solver_PsnAbsMaxCoef [real number]
  Maximal allowed expantion coefficient in adaptive procedure
  for Poisson equation. 

Rho_Deg [positive integer]
  Degree of applied Lobatto polynomials for approximation of electron density.

Rho_Delta [real number]
  Defines the approximation error for electron density.

Scf_MaxIter [positive integer]
  Muximum number of SCF iterations.

Scf_Mix [real number between zero and one]
  Mixing coefficient in SCF procedure.
  
Scf_Diff [positive real number] in hartree
  Stop condition in SCF procedure.

Out_RhoNode [positive integer]
  Number of additional nodes (between computational) for output of electron density.
  This is for smoothing out the plot.
  10 points is usually sufficient.

Out_RhoPath [string]
  Output path for electron density.

Out_EigNode [positive integer]
  Number of additional nodes (between computational) for output of eigenvalues.
  This is for smoothing out the plot.
  10 points is usually sufficient.

Out_EigPath [string]
  Output path for eigenvectors.
